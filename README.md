# Sediment microbial community from a larvae study
This project examined the microbial community associated with sediment collected near the Miami Port and a coral reef system. The data was generated by amplifying the 16S rRNA gene and sequencing on a MiSeq. The corresponding publication to this research is titled Sediment source and dose influence the larval performance of the threatened coral _Orbicella faveolata_ can be found at https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0292474

Provided in this repository is the "Data" folder, which includes the metadata file, ASV count table, and taxonomy table (including in Qiime2 format). In addition, the R code of the data analysis is provided in a jupyter notebook format under the "Notebook" folder.
