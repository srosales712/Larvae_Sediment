**# 🧫 Sediment Microbial Community from a Larvae Study

This project explores the microbial communities associated with sediment samples collected near the **Miami Port** and a nearby **coral reef system** 🌊. The microbial data was generated by amplifying the **16S rRNA gene** and sequencing using **Illumina MiSeq** technology 🔬.
