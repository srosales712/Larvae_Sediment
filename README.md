# Sediment microbial community from a larvae study
This project looked at the microbial community associated with sediment collected near the Port of Miami and a coral reef system. The data was generated by amplyfying the 16S rRNA gene and sequecing on a MiSeq.

Provided in this repository is the Data folder, which includes the metadata file, ASV count table, and taxonomy table (inclusing in the Qiime2 format). In addition, the R code of the data analysis is provided in a jupyter notebook format under the Notebook folder.
